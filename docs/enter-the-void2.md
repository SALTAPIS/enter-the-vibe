The Opening Sequence of "Enter the Void"
A Sensory Assault by Design
The opening title sequence of Gaspar Noé's "Enter the Void" is described as "a melting onslaught of typographic design foisted upon the senses" and "an unrelenting visual overdose" that creates a deliberate sensory overload for the viewer. Enter the Void (2009) — Art of the Title This psychedelic introduction serves as both a technical marvel and a thematic gateway into the film's hallucinatory world.
The Dual Credit Structure
The opening begins with a unique dual credit structure:

Initial End Credits: The film starts with rapidly strobing end credits displayed in a minimalist style, flickering at an extreme pace that immediately destabilizes the viewer's visual perception. Enter the Void (2009) — Art of the Title This unconventional approach is characteristic of Noé's filmmaking style.
Main Title Sequence: Following this comes the main sequence - a typographic tour de force that has become one of cinema's most iconic modern title sequences.

Technical Execution
The main title sequence was created through collaboration between several key figures:

Concept and Direction: Gaspar Noé conceived the overall concept himself, continuing his tradition of personally designing distinctive opening sequences for his films. Enter the Void Title Sequence by Gaspar Noe | Watch the Titles
Typography Design: Franco-Japanese designer Tom Kan created the eclectic typography used throughout the sequence. Noé specifically wanted "a fast-paced compilation of typefaces, all very different, inspired by films, flyers, and neon signs" that would announce the tone of the film.

Title Treatment: German experimental filmmaker Thorsten Fleisch created the electrophotography of the words "Enter The Void" using a unique process. He cut the letters out on cardboard, wrapped them in aluminum foil, and shot approximately 30,000 volts through them to create electric discharges that were captured on photographic paper.

Visual Effects: The French visual effects studio BUF, who were also co-producers of the film, enhanced and refined the visual elements. BUF had previously worked on major films like "The Matrix" and brought their technical expertise to create the "hallucinating visual effects" that define the sequence.

Visual Characteristics
The sequence exhibits several distinctive visual elements:

Typographic Variety: Each credit appears with a different typographic treatment. The designs range from aged metal typefaces to Japanese calligraphy to techno typography, creating a collage of visual styles.

Personalized Credits: Noé wanted each title to reflect the personality of the crew member it credited - a unique approach that made the sequence "a beautiful homage and proof of his respect for the members of the team." Enter the Void (2009) — Art of the Title
Multilingual Text: The sequence features text in French, English, and Japanese, reflecting the film's Tokyo setting and international production. Enter the Void (2009) — Art of the Title
Neon Color Palette: The sequence employs an electric color scheme dominated by vibrant neons - acidic greens, hot pinks, electric blues, and deep purples - that pulse and strobe rhythmically.
Strobing Effects: The credits flash at an increasingly rapid pace, creating a disorienting effect "that borders on inducing seizures" and should come with "a seizure warning." CinemablographyIMDb The extreme pacing deliberately pushes viewers to the edge of visual comprehension.

Auditory Component
The sequence is set to the pounding electronic track "Freak" by British electro artist LFO. Noé chose this particular song because of its energetic, "pushy" quality that perfectly complemented the visual assault.

Artistic Intent
The sequence serves multiple purposes in the film:

Experiential Gateway: The sequence functions as "a real gateway" into the film's world. Kan noted that "its crescendo rhythm leads you to a euphoric ascension" that prepares viewers for the psychedelic journey to follow. Enter the Void (2009) — Art of the Title
Sensory Simulation: The barrage of typography and flashing lights gives viewers "a visual sensation of essentially what it feels like to be tripping on drugs," directly connecting to the film's themes of drug use and altered perception.

Narrative Setup: As with his previous film "Irreversible," Noé designed the credit sequence to allow "audience members to feel as if they are hallucinating before the film has officially begun," establishing the altered state of consciousness that will characterize the entire film.

Artistic Statement: The designers described working on the sequence as being in "a real laboratory," where experimentation and research played huge roles in pushing the boundaries of what title design could achieve. Enter the Void (2009) — Art of the Title

Cultural Impact
The sequence has had significant influence in motion graphics and design, most notably inspiring Kanye West's music video for "All of the Lights" (though the designers noted this was done without proper attribution initially).
