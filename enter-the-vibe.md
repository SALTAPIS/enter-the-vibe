ENTER THE VIBE
OPENING SEQUENCE
BLACK SCREEN.
A single green cursor blinks rhythmically in the darkness. Low synthetic bass begins to pulse, building slowly.
SUDDEN FLASH – screen explodes with cascading neon green code.
THE CREDITS BEGIN
Names blast onto screen in rapid succession, each with unique digital distortion effects – glitching, fracturing, pixelating. Typography shifts between archaic computing fonts and ultramodern designs.
The background morphs between:

Neural network visualizations
Circuit board architectures
Abstract digital landscapes
Matrix-like code waterfalls

Each name pulses with electric energy, staying just long enough to register before being consumed by the digital void.

Names begin accelerating, flashing faster and faster, merging with digital artifacts and code fragments. Synthetic soundtrack builds to a frenetic peak.
The screen splinters into millions of digital particles before reassembling into a first-person view of entering a vast, infinite digital landscape.
